**Intro**

This project is a responsive web based design for a social media outlet where idividuals can upload
their own experiences and collect virtual memoirs of the past.

I have used a few compact design choices for the profile section (grid template, and flex box)
to streamline useful toggle user options: making customization simple.

The flexible layout alows for users of multiple device standards to enjoy without major
interuptions.

Good luck and have fun!
